# Co-pilot_Preparation

When you're whole organisation can search (Microsoft Search) or use co-pilot to search across repositories , we need to be able to report back on the access that Everyone has to certain containers.

this report , is the first wave of access reviews and is meant to be run in batches , say 1000 / 2000 sites in a CSV that the script can loop though all the groups and check what Everyone Except external has access to.
